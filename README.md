> A place to play with JavaScript Promises


## General Info
This really is a "sandbox" project for me to learn about [Promises](http://www.promisejs.org) in JavaScript. 

### Current Focus
Right now, I'm using this project to test out my learning by mixing JS with another one of my interests: mapping and GIS. I've put together some code that uses [ESRI's ArcGIS Geocoding Service](https://geocode.arcgis.com) to look up locations of addresses. I'm still working on using some other ArcGIS services to determine the distance between two points.

### My Learning So Far
I started reading about Promises after googling the topic and discovering an article by Jake Archibald ([@jaffathecake](http://twitter.com/jaffathecake)) that you can find [at this link](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/).

## Future Plans
I hope to update this repo as I learn and continue to play with different techniques.
